# ðŸ§  DSA Practice in C++

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, written in C++.  
Iâ€™m using this repo to track my progress, organize problems by category (arrays, recursion, etc.), and strengthen my problem-solving skills.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- Each folder = one DSA topic (e.g., `arrays/`, `recursion/`)
- Each `.cpp` file = one specific problem solution
- Files may include comments on logic, approach, or problem status

---

## ðŸ“… Progress

I update this repo regularly with new problems as I learn them.  
Check the commit history or browse folders for the latest work.

## ðŸ›  Tech Used

- Language: C++
- Tools: VS Code / Online IDEs
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

## ðŸ’¬ Notes

This repo is primarily for personal learning, but feel free to explore if you're on a similar DSA journey.  
Feedback is always welcome!
